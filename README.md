# GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) refers to a group of satellite systems that provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services worldwide.
These systems allow users to determine their exact location anywhere on Earth using signals from multiple satellites.

1. Major GNSS Systems
   **Global Systems:**
   GPS (Global Positioning System) – United States
   GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System) – Russia
   Galileo – European Union
   BeiDou (BDS) – China

   **Regional Systems:**
   IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) – India
   QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System) – Japan

   Each system consists of a constellation of satellites, ground control stations, and user receivers.

  2. How GNSS Works
   GNSS receivers calculate position by using signals from multiple satellites through a process called trilateration:

   Satellites continuously broadcast signals containing their precise location and time.
   The receiver picks up signals from at least four satellites.
   By measuring the time delay of each signal, the receiver calculates its distance from each satellite.
   Using this data, the receiver determines its exact position (latitude, longitude, altitude).

  3. GNSS Applications
     GNSS is used in multiple fields, including:

     Navigation: Aircraft, ships, cars, and personal devices.
     Surveying & Mapping: Land surveying, geodesy, and GIS applications.
     Autonomous Vehicles: Self-driving cars, UAVs, and precision agriculture.
     Telecommunications: Network synchronization for 4G/5G infrastructure.
     Disaster Management: Search and rescue, earthquake monitoring.
     Military & Defense: Secure navigation, missile guidance, and anti-jamming technologies.
